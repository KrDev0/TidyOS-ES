# TidyOS
Did you switch to Windows 11 (maybe using the Flyby11 app) and feel like the OS is bloated with all its preinstalled apps and unnecessary default settings?

The TidyOS app brings together the best of many of my apps, all wrapped in the simplest UI you'll find on Windows 11—the Start Menu. Yep, that’s exactly how the app looks.

With TidyOS, you can strip Windows 11 down to the essentials, minimizing telemetry, useless settings, and bloatware.
Some of you might know [Tiny11](https://github.com/ntdevlabs/tiny11builder)—this app does basically the same thing, but in a more user-friendly way and directly live on your system.

TidyOS is also highly dynamic, and advanced users can turn any PowerShell script into a plugin using the built-in plugin engine. Native plugins in JSON format have their own syntax as well. Additionally, I’m currently streamlining my GitHub repo and phasing out some projects. All features and scripts designed to create a lighter Windows 11 experience will be moved to TidyOS.

**Note:** ThisIsNot11 does not require elevated privileges for regular use. However, if a higher permission is needed for a specific tweak, the app will let you know and prompt you accordingly.
