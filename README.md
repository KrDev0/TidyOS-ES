# Go11App

Just migrated to Windows 11, maybe even using Flyby11? Now let Go11 help you get your system up and running, tailored to your needs in no time. 
**With just a quick access to your Windows 11 Start menu, Go11App will scan and read your settings and apps, ready for you to start customizing right away**

I’ve already provided some debloating tools for Windows 10 and Windows 11 (like Bloatynosy), and with all the knowledge I’ve gathered, I thought it’s time to craft a solution for the average user. Go11 combines the best of everything in one of the smallest apps in the world.

Fast, efficient, and perfectly sized. No fluff, just functionality.
