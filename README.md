# ThisIsNot11

Just migrated to Windows 11, maybe even using Flyby11? Now let **ThisIsNot11** help you get your system up and running, tailored to your needs in no time. With **just a quick access to your Windows 11 Start menu, **ThisIsNot11** will scan and analyze your settings and apps**, so you can dive straight into customization.

Dont be surprised if the app looks like the Windows 11 Start menu, thats intentional! It’s the first big shock for most after diving into the deep end and upgrading to Windows 11.

The tool is now officially running under ThisIsNot11! For the past two days, it was available under the name Go11, but after some reflection, I realized that name was just too generic. It could really be anything, and that’s not what this tool is about. It’s more than just a utility; it’s about making Windows 11 slimmer and better.

Yesterday marked the 4th anniversary of my first Windows 11 customization tool, ["ThisIsWin11"](https://github.com/builtbybel/ThisIsWin11). Looking back, I’ll admit the UI was pretty rough. But at the time, it was an incredibly simple tool, and it did what it needed to do. The goal was to help users easily customize Windows 11 and make it their own.

Now, ThisIsNot11 takes it further. I’ve made the tool even easier to use while keeping things powerful. This is a tool for everyone. It’s made for the everyday user—someone like Joe Average, who just wants to take control of their system and remove the bloat without any hassle.

ThisIsNot11 is about taking Windows 11 and making it our own again.

**Note:** ThisIsNot11 does not require elevated privileges for regular use. However, if a higher permission is needed for a specific tweak, the app will let you know and prompt you accordingly.
